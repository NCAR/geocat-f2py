C     SUBROUTINE CFFTF(N,C,WSAVE)
C
C     SUBROUTINE CFFTF COMPUTES THE FORWARD COMPLEX DISCRETE FOURIER
C     TRANSFORM (THE FOURIER ANALYSIS). EQUIVALENTLY , CFFTF COMPUTES
C     THE FOURIER COEFFICIENTS OF A COMPLEX PERIODIC SEQUENCE.
C     THE TRANSFORM IS DEFINED BELOW AT OUTPUT PARAMETER C.
C
C     THE TRANSFORM IS NOT NORMALIZED. TO OBTAIN A NORMALIZED TRANSFORM
C     THE OUTPUT MUST BE DIVIDED BY N. OTHERWISE A CALL OF CFFTF
C     FOLLOWED BY A CALL OF CFFTB WILL MULTIPLY THE SEQUENCE BY N.
C
C     THE ARRAY WSAVE WHICH IS USED BY SUBROUTINE CFFTF MUST BE
C     INITIALIZED BY CALLING SUBROUTINE CFFTI(N,WSAVE).
C
C     INPUT PARAMETERS
C
C
C     N      THE LENGTH OF THE COMPLEX SEQUENCE C. THE METHOD IS
C            MORE EFFICIENT WHEN N IS THE PRODUCT OF SMALL PRIMES. N
C
C     C      A COMPLEX ARRAY OF LENGTH N WHICH CONTAINS THE SEQUENCE
C
C     WSAVE   A REAL WORK ARRAY WHICH MUST BE DIMENSIONED AT LEAST 4N+15
C             IN THE PROGRAM THAT CALLS CFFTF. THE WSAVE ARRAY MUST BE
C             INITIALIZED BY CALLING SUBROUTINE CFFTI(N,WSAVE) AND A
C             DIFFERENT WSAVE ARRAY MUST BE USED FOR EACH DIFFERENT
C             VALUE OF N. THIS INITIALIZATION DOES NOT HAVE TO BE
C             REPEATED SO LONG AS N REMAINS UNCHANGED THUS SUBSEQUENT
C             TRANSFORMS CAN BE OBTAINED FASTER THAN THE FIRST.
C             THE SAME WSAVE ARRAY CAN BE USED BY CFFTF AND CFFTB.
