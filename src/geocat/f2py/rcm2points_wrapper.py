    """Interpolates data on a curvilinear grid (i.e. RCM, WRF, NARR) to an
    unstructured grid.

    Interpolates data on a curvilinear grid, such as those used by the RCM
    (Regional Climate Model), WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) and NARR
    (North American Regional Reanalysis) models/datasets to an unstructured grid.
    All of these have latitudes that are oriented south-to-north. An inverse
    distance squared algorithm is used to perform the interpolation. Missing
    values are allowed and no extrapolation is performed.

    Parameters
    -----------

    lat2d : :class:`xarray.DataArray`, :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        A two-dimensional array that specifies the latitudes locations of ``fi``. The latitude
        order must be south-to-north. Because this array is two-dimensional it is not an
        associated coordinate variable of ``fi``, so it should always be explicitly provided.

    lon2d : :class:`xarray.DataArray`, :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        A two-dimensional array that specifies the longitude locations of ``fi``. The longitude
        order must be west-to-east. Because this array is two-dimensional it is not an
        associated coordinate variable of ``fi``, so it should always be explicitly provided.

    fi : :class:`xarray.DataArray`, :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        A multi-dimensional array to be interpolated. The rightmost two dimensions (latitude,
        longitude) are the dimensions to be interpolated.

    lat1d : :class:`xarray.DataArray`, :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        A one-dimensional array that specifies the latitude coordinates of the output locations.

    lon1d : :class:`xarray.DataArray`, :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        A one-dimensional array that specifies the longitude coordinates of the output locations.

    opt : :obj:`numpy.number`
        ``opt=0`` or ``1`` means use an inverse distance weight interpolation.
        ``opt=2`` means use a bilinear interpolation.

    msg : :obj:`numpy.number`
        A numpy scalar value that represent a missing value in ``fi``. This argument allows a user to
        use a missing value scheme other than NaN or masked arrays, similar to what NCL allows.

    meta : :obj:`bool`
        If set to True and the input array is an Xarray, the metadata from the input array will be
        copied to the output array; default is False.
        Warning: This option is not currently supported.

    Returns
    -------

        fo : :class:`xarray.DataArray`, :class:`numpy.ndarray`
            The interpolated grid. A multi-dimensional array of the same size as ``fi`` except that the
            rightmost dimension sizes have been replaced by the number of coordinate pairs (``lat1d``,
            ``lon1d``).
